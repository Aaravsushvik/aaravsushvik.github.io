    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <div class="About Me">
        <h3>Language </h3>
        <p class="text">

        <h3>MY MY DRAWBACKS (G SAI SUSHVIK)</h3>

        </p>
        <h3>Value, Ethics, and Aesthetics</h3>
        <p class="text">
            Sometimes some ideas are so beautiful that you will momentarily accept and revere them before analyzing them. My
            ethics will only ever be direct deductions from my metaphysics. All other accepted ethics will be rejected. Like
            that of Schopenhauer! You are a plague. Love. I want to understand how we assume value in things. Bias is different
            but love is same. There is no meaning in this world. There are 2 cars and 5 pens in this world. Love is every experience you call love. 
            Likewise, other emotions. I think it is only in the mind that one can love. I need a computer that can render love for me. 
            Love is a man's truest and most creative expression. Access to storage is empowerment! Inspiration is more real than love! 
            Confidence and Exploration depend on the type of sense of ownership! Government cannot control morals. Value arises from the contract. 
            No value ever is not from some contract. To love someone is an amazing painkiller, and a good night's sleep! 
            Unlike geographies, thoughts aren't tactile and aren't limited, so publicness is not a responsibility in virtual groups. 
            Respect is a protocol? or a feeling? I consider a drone as an organism. The alien within. It might be the case that God created us, but I don't think he cares about our morality. 
            Value requires a valuer. It's morally wrong if you hurt any sentient being, and also it is morally wrong if you disrespectfully damage any nonliving tool you have. 
            What is not boring? Is art boring? Not just humanity. Consciousness first. Bored while pooping. Practice more of what is important, what you love. 
            It is very hard to focus without a purpose. You are my stakeholder. Creativity is not about control, it is about letting go. 
            What makes beauty appealing is that it is useful.
        </p>
        <h3>Epistemology (About Knowledge)</h3>
        <p class="text">
            I don't know if any of the things I say are correct at all! I'm afraid, I don't even seem to understand the nature
            of correctness at all. Did I ever prove anything in my life? I don’t know anything for certain; this feeling is
            heavy, yet I will act. A Probabilistic trust model is peaceful for the mind. Is truth always inspiring? Truth is
            important. Nonsense is everywhere. Learning and Knowledge are personal! It is our duty (and is an advantage) to
            support the truth. Some truths are more important than food and money. Part of the truth is disliking, liking,
            action, and inaction. My belief is my knowledge. Education is all about equipping with tools.
        </p>
        <h3>Critical and Social</h3>
        <p class="text">
            A nation may brand itself as a unifying agent, but all nations, like all classes/categories, are divided by
            definition. My eyes look like that of a dead man. They are dull. But I like them. They show me this world and art.
            Metaphysics is the presumption from which you derive all other studies! I want to have good conversations, I want to
            be fearless. I am a free man. Commands are programs written by someone else. In company, you kill yourself. I don't
            live in the real world. So, I can't thrive by usual standards. Freedom from god, freedom from bonds, and freedom
            from the state are liberation from the external. Standing for oneself is the sexiest quality. Only compute-intensive
            philosophies should try to reach more people for their brains. What is the difference between a nation and a social
            group? I want to have good conversations, I want to be fearless. I think honesty helps you appreciate other honest
            people. I deeply desire to engage in conversations. Conversations that never happened. I still stand on the fact
            that doing philosophy is a luxury. Why nihilists won't suicide? In fact, everything is just a category/class. They
            don't have meaning at all. LED, Bus, Man, Taste,... I think we rely a lot on language to propagate and represent
            knowledge. The reality "continues" to exist. I think I should fix the language. There is no freedom in the true
            sense. I think it is important to listen to everyone's voice. One cannot understand what is wrong. Some people can
            believe the wrong and also expect you to believe it. This isn't impossible. When you have infinite love, try loving
            animals. Obviously, output depends on the tools used. Breaking laws makes bad laws clear. Plan in language space and
            execute in action space. Philosophy is not a belief system nor is it a knowledge system. Present your self-fatal
            questions! There's nothing unique about being the world's tallest building. Some things are to be given to the most
            dedicated, not necessarily to the best! It is empowerment to be able to do shit on the web! Statistically, it is
            actually good for individuals to take the responsibility of learning certain knowledge whether or not it is useful
            for them personally. I love how world states and problems can be mathematically put. How important is it to
            understand the rules of society? How to frame society as a robotic system? Missed duties are more daunting than
            missed opportunities. As long as I can afford quality food, health, shelter, internet, and time for friends I am
            cool. I can just imagine other expensive shit! Society: Multiple intelligent swarms with plenty of independent
            self-centric agents in them. With every word I type/say, I am feeling conscious that I'm using language. I don't
            want to pay for any education! The foundation of any system = exploitation. Bring meme culture to political
            relevance. Need for Alien Policy. When you learn a language, you change. All that is needed to do great work is to
            do what you love. For me, India is a territory, not a specific people. The healthiest are the smartest. I have
            nothing to do with any religion. To accelerate human evolution. One should be conscious enough to figure out if
            they are in a dilemma. I go through multiple of them each day. Some noticed, some not. Altruists have no empathy
            for themselves. Dextrousity gave us cognition. Common sense is social sense. Alienation is a real problem. Try not
            to alienate others and try to familiarize yourself with alien situations. Sociological Imagination can help you
            appreciate that you are a part of society. Give people wonderful tools, and they will do wonderful things. I have a
            dream to map the entire world in 3D and 4Pi. Religion is an imagination. Any intelligent trade is a win-win. Self-
            interest prevails. There is no such thing as a free lunch. Technological borders Nation-state borders. Overhauling
            the status quo/society completely is not as hard as it immediately strikes. We are just changing the present, not
            the whole history behind it. Ex: Question of God. It's not about learning the popular tools, it is about finding
            the right tools for your use case. Everyone should become an entrepreneur. Without regular affirmation, you will
            lose your patriotism. Curb hatred, and that's all. People can be freer without guns in their hands. Games create
            strong social bonds. You are simply your society/nation. Can unaddressed memories in a computer give it
            consciousness? Each moment/iteration asks itself, what it should, where it should get its arguments from?... Is our brain discretely
            functioning with time? We shouldn't be dismissive of bad ideas. Inference to the best explanation. Humans are not
            the center. You don't need to abuse the law as long as you understand the risk of not respecting it. One day I want
            to be able to buy time. Apples, peaches, pears, and plums are all from the Rose family. IIT made me feel national;
            Hyderabad made me feel national; Telugu made me feel national; Even Technology made me feel national. But,
            Hinduism couldn't. Because it never really mattered to me as an INDIVIDUAL. Houses protect humans from other
            animals. Society protects one human from the other humans. Treaties protect one society from the other. Only Culture
            can protect society from itself and its wrongdoings. Democratizing every industry. No one's classical unless they
            are taught to be. Social will is created. Not yielded by the weight of society, I am a little strange. Labs are
            prisons⛓. I can neither promise rights nor force duties in and on any society. I am just a developing animal. Love
            the people of your nation. If you are classical, you are not understanding yourself. I am not just me but my
            society, and I am selfish. Education is a tool, but every time you use it, it doesn't wear but grows. Consciousness,
            I wish. A good teacher protects his students from his own influence. Once you start, you start enjoying. I plan only
            to understand what's important to me. I think people need better feedback. Selfish gene. My child will be a cyborg.
